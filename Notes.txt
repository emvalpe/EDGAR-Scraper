a list of every company in america, the question now is where to make a connection to each.
this also begs the question of whether or not I can connect these public comapnies to private ones

search with: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch
based on a companies 10k form, not 10Q (quartely vs yearly), item 15 in part 4, exhibit 21.1**

html of target element:
<span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Helvetica',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">21.1**</span>
the href in this parent element will take me to a list of subsidiaries

so to find a company that has merged with another you look at the 2.01 of an 8k form(for companies hosted in the US) 6k for the other

multitasking!!!!!!
 - python sucks because it has something called the GIL, designed to limit threads
 - multithreading vs multiprocessing
  - threading, to multithread
  - ex:
   from threading import Thread

   threadlist = []

   threadlist.append(Thread(target=toast_bread))
   threadlist.append(Thread(target=boil_water_and_egg))
   threadlist.append(Thread(target=make_some_coffee))

   for t in threadlist:
     t.start()

   for t in threadlist:
     t.join()

  - multiprocessing, to utilize multiple cores, not needed yet I guess, hard math and things
   - from multiprocessing import Process

   processlist = []

   processlist.append(Process(target=do_math_homework)))
   processlist.append(Process(target=do_physics_homework))
   processlist.append(Process(target=do_chemistry_homework))

   for t in processlist:
     t.start()

   for t in processlist:
     t.join()
